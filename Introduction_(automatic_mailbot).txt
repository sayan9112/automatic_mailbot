Abstract: This is one of a automation project to automate mail using python. 
          By this feature one can send his mail via only voice command. He
          will write the addresses, subject, messege via voice.
 
code changes: In [def send_email(receiver, subject, message)] we have to put 
              sender_email_address, and sender_email_password.
              We have to create our own email list.

Google setting: We have to change the google setting as we are using our own 
                bot for sending mails. We have just to enable 'Less Secure 
                App Access' to give permission.
                open_gmail_account>manage_your_google_account>security>
                less_secure_app_access------(enable it)

    THAT'S IT.
    OUR automatic_mailbot is ready to sending mails.
